JSErrorCollector
---------------

This project allows to capture JavaScript errors while running tests with [WebDriver].
Ideally this feature should be built-in [WebDriver] but it is not (yet?) the case (see WebDriver issue [API for checking for JavaScript errors on the page] for details).

Features:
 - provide access to JavaScript errors while running tests with a FirefoxDriver 

Download:
Pre-built jar file is available [here|
